# autoML-using-pycaret-
- The repository consists of automatic building of machine learning models using Pycaret.

- The autoML trained is on diamond dataset from pycaret but it can be trained on your custom datset by replacing data in model file.

- Mention the kind of model you want to train in the config

  modeltype = regression if regression model 
  modeltype = classification if classification model

- If you want train a specific model, you can specify the name of the model in the config

  for example if you want random forest model to be built 
  modelname = 'rf'
